# Code of conduct

The group is committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes but is not limited to members of any gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, social and economic class, educational level, mental and physical ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of group members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any work event, including group meetings, conferences, talks, parties, Twitter and other online media. This code of conduct applies to all group members, including leadership, and applies to all modes of interaction, both in-person and online, including GitHub project repos, Slack channels, and Twitter.

Group members violating these rules may be referred to the Fred Hutch Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division Director, the Fred Hutch Ombudsperson, the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, and/or the Office of General Counsel, as appropriate, and will no longer be part of the group.

**All group members agree to:**

* *be considerate* in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of other members;
* *be respectful* -- disagreements happen, but do not require poor behavior or poor manners. Frustration is inevitable, but it should never turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Group members should be respectful with other members in the group as well as members outside of the group;
* *refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech* -- harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert Brian Williamson and Ying Huang;
* *take care of each other* -- refrain from advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior. And, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Alert a faculty member, staff member, or appropriate authorities if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
